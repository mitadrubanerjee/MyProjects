    "In the notebook, I have built 3 different models, Auto-encoder (AE), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The idea in this project is to generate images using 3 models, AE, VAE and GAN. I have tested them on the Fashion MNIST Dataset and have presented the results. \n",

    "\n",
    "I have not used the Convolution layers in any of the models and have only used the Dense layers to build the three models. Thus I have not developed any DCGAN, but have stuck to developing GAN. I ahve maintained a similar weight structure across all the layers of all the models. "

    "In the Project I have used the Fashion MNIST Dataset for the purpose of generating images. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, with 60,000 examples in the training set and 10,000 examples in the test set. Each of the datapoints is a 28x28 grayscale image with a label from one of ten classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Application: The dataset has been developed by Zalando, which is quite useful for benchmarking Machine Learning algorithms. This is particularly useful as it provides 28X28 grayscale images, which can be fed conveniently into the ML Algorithms. The data set can also be used, as in this Project, to generate images. The MNIST Fashion dataset is a set of greayscale images. The major use of the dataset more than anything else is to benchmark created Machine Learning Algorithms.  "

In the model the input data will be passed through the encoder, which will reduce the dimension of the data and this compressed data will be passed through the decoder to produce the recosntructed output. This compressed data is called the bottleneck (z), thus the best encoder will reduce the dimension of teh data, without losing any important information of the data. \n",

    "The essential difference in this case is that the encoder will be outputing the mean and standard deviation on which a sampling operation will be carried out. Thus each dimension in the latent space will be represented by the mean and sd. The sampling carried out will help the VAE achieve a smooth represenation. This will be fed into the Decoder as the input. \n",

    "The VAE trains its parametrs using two principla loss functions, reconstruction and regularization loss, this can help reduce the overfitting of data. We use the Kullback-Leibler (statistical measure to calculate difference between a pair of distributions)loss as the regularization term in the VAE loss. \n",

    "\n",
    "GANs are a framework for teaching a Deep Learning model to understand the distribution of the training data so that we can generate new data (image generation in this case) from that same distribution. They consist of two distinct models: a generator and a discriminator. The generator's job is to generate 'fake' images that resemble the training images. The discriminator's job is to examine an image and determine whether it is a genuine training image or a bogus image generated by the generator. During training, the generator is constantly trying to outwit the discriminator by creating better and better fakes, while the discriminator is working to improve as a detective and correctly classify the real and fake images. \n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the generator improves at creating realistic-looking images, while the discriminator improves at telling them apart. The ideal condition is when the discriminator can no longer distinguish between real and fake images. "

    "In the below lines of code, I have developed the Generator and Discriminator first. I have brought them all together by creating the GAN. I ahve then normalized the data between a range of [-1,1] and then fed it into the GAN during the training process. I am using a set of images of the size 28*28; this is why the shape of the input layer will be that of the latenet space (which as defined in this case is 98). The output of the Generator will be of 784 as that is the size of the image in this case. The activation of the Generator output must be tanh as the data must be represented within  arnge of [-1,1]. In a similar way the Discriminator is supposed to identify if the images are real or fake, so its inputs are that of the size of the image, whereas the output has an activation of sigmoid. Thus the Discriminator will essentially act as an image classifier, determining if the image is fake or real. Thus in the model the Generator will be trainable, but the Discriminator will not be trainable. \n",

    "I have run the 3 models AE, VAE and GAN in the above sections of my code. Of all the results of the models, the AE and The VAE seem to have better generated the images when compared to the images generated by the GAN. I have run two models of the VAE by tuning the hyperparameters like learning rate and number of epochs. I have used the Fashion MNIST Dataset for the Project, so the images are all in greyscale, discernable from each other by the shapes, border and structures. The data being fed into the models are of the shape 28*28. \n",

    "\n",
    "    The results of the auto-encoder are quite good at the following hyperparamters: epochs = 250; batch size = 256 and adam    optimizer. I had run the AE with 100 epochs initially, but the image reconstruction was not as good. On increasing the number of epochs the results seemed to be better. The validation loss also had a steday decline, initially starting at 0.02, but after 250 epochs the validation loss reduced significantly to 0.01. The validation loss kept constant after 200 epochs and did not show any significant decline. \n",

    "    I have run the VAE model twice using different sets of paramters:\n",

    "    * 1) Run 1:learning rate at 0.0001, epochs at 100 and batch_size of 32. The validation loss at start was ranging around 12.2, while after 100 epochs the validation loss came down to around 7.4. The images reconstructed after about 100 epochs, was quite decent, but the borders and specifications of the images were not very pronounced. \n",
    "    * 2) Run 2: learning rate at 0.00001, epochs at 100 and batch_size of 64. The validation loss with this model run started at around 7.4, but even after running for 250 epochs the validation loss did not show a significant decline. The images geenrated by this run of the model was marginally better than the ones produced by the first model run, but the differences were not very pronounced. \n",

    "\n",
    "    * 1)Run 1: The number of epochs in this run is dependent on the size of the training set. As the MNIST Fashion tarining set had around 60,000 images; I set the batch size at 1000, epochs at 100, which means the number of iterations for the training process would be around 6000. I ran the model with quite a few settings, finding this setting to be the best in creating the most discernable image. The accuracy on the  fake images does not show a significant rise, even after running it for nealry 6000 steps. \n",
    "    * 2) Run 2: I am setting the epochs at 250, with 60,000 training images, and a batch size of 1000. This would set the number of steps at 15,000. The performance of the GAN is better in this run, when compared to the first run of the model, even then the images that have been generated are not very good.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "All the models are generating images which have discernable borders and structures. All the images that have been generated can be isolated and identified independently. From the results of the models, it can be said that the AE and VAE (Model run 2: learning rate at 0.0001, epochs at 100 and batch_size of 64) seem to give the best image generation, whereas the images generated by the GAN (both Model 1 and 2) seem to be not performing as well. The images generated by the second model run of the GAN is better compared to the first one. So, improving the number of epochs might further improve the images being generated. \n",

    "### Possible Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "I have developed the AE, VAE and GAN in the Notebook, but I have not made a DC (Deep COnvoloution) GAN. In the GAN that I have developed, I have only used the Dense layers and have not used any Convolutional layers. It might be possible to improve the performance of the GAN, by adding BatchNormalization layers to the existing model. It might also be possible to change the ADAM Optimizer to RMSProp. This would make the GAN into a DCGAN, which might be able to give better results of image generation. "
